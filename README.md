Consider some situations : 


* You went shopping in a mart and spent couple of hours choosing items with best combination of quality and discount (The generic middle class startegy ;). You are tired and then you see a long queue at the biling counter. Clearly this isn't happy shopping ?


* Imagine a virus got spread in the country which spreads rapidily through human interaction and now you have to maintain 'Social Distancing'(sounds familiar huh?:). Now how will you buy your essential items to stay quarantined in your house with minimal human interaction ?


* Imagine You are the last person on earth... ohk I took it too far just jump to the next part.

For situtations like this we have got the perfect solution for you :- **Zelf Karte**
